## Background
Fractal Tree will be built recursively, every branch will have 2 branches. I plan to be able to keep track of the number of recursive steps and let the tree be built on a click of a button for better visualization.

## MVP
Fractal Trees will allow:
<li> visualization of tree being built recursively
<li> try to implement another form of recursive function for variation of building fractal tree. L-System will allow tree to be built at angle
<li> Use Bezier Curves from Canvas API to add curves to branches, after initial build
<li> Description of algorithm being used to create tree

## Technologies
I will use Javascript to implement the creation of the tree and Canvas for visualization.
