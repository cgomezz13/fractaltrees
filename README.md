## Background
Binary Fractal Trees are built recursively, every branch has 2 branches that stem from it. This project explores the different approaches to building a fractal tree such as: recursively, using an L-System and Object Oriented model. This provides visualization of the different approaches.

## Features
Fractal Trees allow:
* visualization of trees being built through different approaches
* Description of algorithm being used to create tree
* Description of advantages and disadvatages to each approach


## Technologies
Javascript was used to implement the creation of the tree and Canvas for visualization.

## Future Features
* Get leaves to fall from OO Tree
* Allow user to input angle they would like to create a fractal tree
* Add color options for leaves
