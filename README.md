### Backgroud
<br>
Fractal Tree will be built recursively, every branch will have 2 branches. I plan to be able to keep track of the number of recursive steps and let the tree be built on a click of a button for better visualization.

### MVP
<br>
Fractal Trees will allow:
<li> visualization of tree being built recursively
<li> try to implement another form of recursive function for variation of building fractal tree. L-System will allow tree to be built at angle
<li> Use Bezier Curves from Canvas API to add curves to branches, after initial build
<li> Description of algorithm being used to create tree

### Technologiies
<br>
I will use Javascript for the game logic in this project and Canvas as well to manipulate the branch thickness. 

### Implementation Timeline
<br>
Day 1: 
Set up skeleton for project and decide what base case will be for this recursive project. Learn how to use canvas. Start recursive algorithm.
Day 2: 
Complete backend algorithm for recusively done fractal trees and edit to  and make prettier with canvas tools.
Day 3: 
Make front-end view nicer
